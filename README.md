# AI-Powered-Document-Q-A-System
This project enables users to upload PDF documents and ask questions based on their content. Using LLMs and vector embeddings, the system retrieves relevant document sections and generates context-aware responses.

Technologies Used:
Hugging Face (Mistral-7B) – LLM for text generation
LangChain – Framework for building LLM applications
ChromaDB – Vector database for efficient document retrieval
Sentence-Transformers (all-mpnet-base-v2) – Text embedding model
PyPDFLoader – PDF text extraction
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter – Splitting documents into manageable chunks
